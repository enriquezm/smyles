## Creating a button

### The Plan

1. Build a button using the `<button>` element that HTML has available.
2. Style that button so it looks very nice (ex. rounded corners, bg color, and label color)
3. Set up some basic javaScript so that when we click that button, it logs to the console.

Now, I'm very impatient, so let's just get right into it. I'll explain details as we run into them.

### Building the Structure

Now when we say "build" the button, that could mean a lot of things. To be more specific, we want to build button's structure, the so called "skeleton". How do we do this? With HTML! Now before I continue blabbering on, let's get a visual of what that looks like:

```
<button></button>
```

Boom! And there you go, an HTML button element has appeared.

Now, on it's own, a button element is pretty much useless. Let's give it some life by providing some text, or rather, a button label like so:

```
<button>Log to the Console</button>
```

What we have here is a button, with the label "Log to the Console".
